# So the YouTube trending page died...

This repo is to host a github pages website that roughly mimics the old YouTube trending page.

The website should be live at [https://neonorangeorange.github.io/YT-Trending/](https://neonorangeorange.github.io/YT-Trending/)


# Notes on setup

- Make sure your api key works
- Create a repository secret, not an environment secret
